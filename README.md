# tar-acquainting
Experiment for [security-tranquilizer](https://github.com/KacperPerschke/security-tranquilizer).

## The goal

Learn to use the [tar](https://pkg.go.dev/archive/tar) library.

The following are the three steps for verification.

 1. [Is it done?] Do I know how to pack files, files in arbitrarily nested subdirectories, whole directories with subdirectories?
 1. [Is it done?] Do I know how to unpack the archive built in the above step?
 1. [Is it done?] Do I know how to preserve permissions and dates when using the two steps above?
